    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This make-ahead turkey gravy frees up valuable kitchen time for Thanksgiving, plus it will look and taste even better than those frantic, last-minute versions. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 large onion, chopped </li> 
          <li>2 carrots, chopped </li> 
          <li>2 ribs celery, chopped </li>
          <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil </li>
          <li>2 large turkey wings </li>
          <li>2 tablespoons cold water </li>
          <li>10 cups cold water</li>
          <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme </li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic (Optional)</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons butter </li>
          <li>Â½ cup all-purpose flour </li>
          <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
          <li>pinch cayenne pepper </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine onion, carrots, celery, and vegetable oil in a large roasting pan and toss to coat. Place turkey wings on top of vegetables</li>
            <li>Place roasting pan in the preheated oven and cook until the turkey wings are browned and vegetables are caramelized and softened, 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer turkey wings and vegetables to a large stockpot. Place the roasting pan over a stovetop burner on medium heat. Pour 2 tablespoons cold water into the pan and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits. Transfer mixture to the stockpot and add 10 cups cold water, thyme, and garlic.</li>
            <li>Bring turkey wing mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until meat falls off the bone, about 3 hours. Skim off turkey fat throughout the process and set aside 2 tablespoons.</li>
            <li>Strain turkey stock and reserve 6 cups of stock; discard all the solids.</li>
            <li>Heat butter and 2 tablespoons reserved turkey fat in a large saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle in flour and cook, whisking continuously, until it begins to smell like cooked pie crust, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly pour in turkey stock, whisking continuously. Increase heat to high and simmer until thick and warmed through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
