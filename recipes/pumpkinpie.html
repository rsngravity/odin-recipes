    <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>It's one of the iconic flavors of the fall season, with its popularity peaking around Thanksgiving. That's a lot of expectations for such a down-to-earth pie to bear. Read on to learn how to make pumpkin pie from scratch, and get top-rated recipes to try — including pie fillings made from fresh pumpkin or canned pumpkin, crustless pumpkin pie, and no-bake pumpkin pie.</p>
        <p>Pumpkin pie is a custard-based pie with a sweet filling typically made of pumpkin purée mixed with eggs, evaporated milk, and warm spices such as cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Pumpkin pie is typically an open-face, single crust pie baked in a pastry crust or a graham cracker crust, or you can make a crustless pumpkin pie, if you prefer. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup shortening</li>
            <li>3 ½ tablespoons cold water</li>
            <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pumpkin</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Unless you're using canned pumpkin, you'll first need to prepare the mashed pumpkin. Start with 1 1/2 pounds of skin-on, raw pumpkin to yield 2 cups of mashed</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour, sugar, and salt.</li>
            <li>With lightly floured, hands shape dough into a ball. On a lightly floured board, roll dough out to about 1/8 inch thickness.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat pumpkin with evaporated milk, eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt with an electric mixer or immersion blender. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Bake 40 minutes or until when a knife is inserted 1 inch from the edge comes out clean. See below for more tips on how to tell when your pie is done. </li>
